# ESG Reporting for Small Businesses: A Practical Getting Started Guide

If you're a small or mid-sized supplier, you've probably received an ESG questionnaire from a large customer and thought: "This is for multinational corporations, not us." But ESG reporting is now a supply chain requirement, not a nice-to-have. The good news? Small businesses don't need a 200-page sustainability report or a six-figure consultant. You need the 80/20 approach: the 20% of data that answers 80% of questions.

Here's what ESG reporting actually requires when you're a small business.

## What ESG Reporting Really Means for Small Businesses

ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. For small suppliers, it boils down to:

- **Environmental**: How much energy and resources you use, and how much waste you generate
- **Social**: How you treat employees (safety, wages, training, diversity)
- **Governance**: Whether you have basic policies and ethical practices

You're not being asked to save the planet. You're being asked to demonstrate you're a responsible, low-risk partner.

## The Core Data Small Businesses Actually Need

### Environmental Data

**1. Annual Energy Consumption**

Track electricity and fuel usage. This comes from utility bills.

- Total kWh of electricity per year
- Natural gas (cubic meters or therms)
- Fuel for vehicles (litres of diesel/petrol)

Why it matters: Energy is the foundation of carbon footprint calculations. Customers ask for this in every ESG questionnaire.

**2. Water Usage**

If your operations use significant water (manufacturing, food production, washing), track annual consumption in cubic meters.

**3. Waste Generation**

How much waste do you produce, and what percentage is recycled vs. landfilled? Many small businesses can estimate this from waste hauler invoices.

### Social Data

**4. Workforce Metrics**

- Total number of employees
- Employee turnover rate
- Gender breakdown (for diversity reporting)
- Average hours of training per employee per year

**5. Health & Safety**

- Number of recordable workplace injuries (OSHA or local equivalent)
- Lost-time injury rate
- Whether you conduct safety training (and how often)

### Governance Data

**6. Policies and Procedures**

Do you have written policies covering:

- Environmental protection
- Health and safety
- Anti-corruption and business ethics
- Human rights and labour standards
- Data protection

These don't need to be fancy. A two-page policy document for each area, signed by management, is sufficient.

**7. Certifications**

- Quality: ISO 9001
- Environment: ISO 14001
- Safety: ISO 45001
- Industry-specific standards (FSC, GOTS, etc.)

If you don't have certifications, that's okay. But if you do, they're major credibility points.

## The 80/20 ESG Data Collection Plan

Here's a realistic three-step approach for small businesses:

### Step 1: Collect What You Already Have (Week 1)

Most of this data exists; you just haven't organized it.

- **Energy bills**: Gather 12 months of electricity and fuel invoices
- **Payroll records**: Pull headcount, turnover, and demographics
- **Safety logs**: Compile injury records and training attendance
- **Certificates**: Scan copies of ISO or industry certifications

### Step 2: Fill the Gaps (Week 2-3)

For missing data, start simple:

- **Waste tracking**: Contact your waste hauler for annual tonnage and recycling rates
- **Water usage**: If not metered separately, estimate based on bills or industry benchmarks
- **Training hours**: If not formally tracked, estimate average hours per employee (e.g., safety induction + job-specific training)

### Step 3: Write or Update Basic Policies (Week 4)

If you lack formal policies, create one-page documents covering:

- **Environmental policy**: Commitment to comply with regulations, reduce waste, and improve efficiency
- **Code of conduct**: Anti-corruption, fair treatment, and ethical business practices
- **Health & safety policy**: Commitment to safe working conditions and incident prevention

Sign and date them. Store them centrally.

## Common Small Business ESG Questions (and How to Answer Them)

**"Do I need to hire a sustainability consultant?"**

Not to get started. Consultants are useful for complex carbon accounting or setting science-based targets, but most small businesses can handle basic ESG data collection internally.

**"What if my numbers aren't great?"**

Report them anyway. Customers care more about transparency and improvement trends than perfection. A small manufacturer with 10% waste diversion who's honest about it is better than one who avoids reporting.

**"How often do I need to update this data?"**

Annually for most metrics. Energy, water, and workforce data should be updated yearly. Policies should be reviewed every 1-2 years.

**"What's the minimum viable ESG report?"**

For small suppliers, it's usually not a public report at all. It's a well-organized internal file that lets you quickly respond to customer questionnaires. Using tools like ESG Passport, you can store this data once and auto-populate responses instead of starting from scratch every time a new questionnaire arrives.

## What Small Businesses Don't Need to Worry About (Yet)

- **Scope 3 emissions**: Upstream and downstream supply chain emissions are for large corporations. Focus on Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (electricity) first.
- **Science-Based Targets (SBTi)**: These are for companies with significant emissions. Small suppliers aren't expected to have SBT commitments.
- **TCFD or GRI reporting frameworks**: These are for listed companies or large entities. Customers aren't expecting SMEs to publish 100-page GRI-aligned sustainability reports.
- **Third-party assurance**: External audits of ESG data are expensive and rarely required for small suppliers unless you're in a high-risk industry.

## Building the Habit of ESG Data Collection

The biggest barrier isn't complexity, it's consistency. Small businesses that succeed at ESG reporting build simple habits:

**Monthly**: Review utility bills and record consumption in a spreadsheet

**Quarterly**: Update safety incident logs and training records

**Annually**: Review and update policies, calculate totals, and prepare for customer questionnaires

**Assign ownership**: Designate someone (even part-time) to maintain ESG data. This could be a finance manager, operations lead, or even an admin with good organizational skills.

## The Business Case for Small Business ESG Reporting

Beyond compliance, ESG reporting helps small businesses:

1. **Win contracts**: More RFPs include ESG criteria. No data = no bid.
2. **Identify savings**: Tracking energy and waste often reveals cost reduction opportunities.
3. **Improve resilience**: Understanding resource use helps you prepare for price volatility or regulatory changes.
4. **Attract talent**: Younger workers increasingly choose employers with clear values and practices.

## Conclusion

ESG reporting for small businesses isn't about becoming a sustainability leader or publishing glossy reports. It's about having the basic data and documentation to demonstrate you're a responsible, well-managed supplier.

Start with the essentials: energy consumption, workforce metrics, safety records, and simple policies. Track them consistently. Store them where you can find them when questionnaires arrive.

Most importantly, stop waiting for perfection. The companies that succeed at ESG reporting aren't the ones with perfect data. They're the ones who start tracking, stay consistent, and improve over time.
