# IntegrityNext Questionnaire: How to Prepare and What to Expect

If you've received an IntegrityNext invitation from a customer, you're about to complete one of the most detailed supplier ESG questionnaires in use today. IntegrityNext is a compliance and sustainability platform used by major German manufacturers (automotive, industrial, electronics) and increasingly by multinationals across industries.

Unlike simpler questionnaires, IntegrityNext digs deep into your policies, processes, and evidence. Here's what to expect and how to prepare.

## What Is IntegrityNext?

IntegrityNext is a supplier risk management platform that assesses suppliers on ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) and compliance topics. Companies use it to meet due diligence obligations under laws like the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) and similar EU regulations.

When a buyer invites you, you'll create an account, complete a questionnaire, and upload supporting documents. The buyer then reviews your responses and may flag risks or request follow-up.

## IntegrityNext vs. EcoVadis: Key Differences

Both assess ESG performance, but they differ significantly:

| Aspect | IntegrityNext | EcoVadis |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Assessment model** | Self-assessment reviewed by buyer | Third-party analyst scores you |
| **Scoring** | Risk-based (red/yellow/green flags) | Percentile score (0-100) with medal tiers |
| **Focus** | Compliance, due diligence, risk mitigation | Sustainability performance and management systems |
| **Tone** | Legal/regulatory compliance | Continuous improvement |
| **Outcome** | Pass/fail or risk rating | Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum medals |
| **Transparency** | Buyer sees detailed answers | Buyer sees score and summary report |

**Bottom line**: IntegrityNext is more about proving you're not a compliance risk, while EcoVadis is about demonstrating sustainability maturity.

## Main Question Categories in IntegrityNext

IntegrityNext questionnaires vary by industry and buyer, but they typically cover these core areas:

### 1. Human Rights and Labor Standards

This is the heaviest section, especially post-LkSG regulations.

**Topics covered**:

- Forced labor and modern slavery
- Child labor
- Freedom of association and collective bargaining
- Working hours and overtime
- Fair wages (minimum wage compliance, living wage commitments)
- Discrimination and harassment
- Health and safety at work

**What they want**:

- Policies covering each area
- Evidence of compliance (payroll records showing minimum wage, contracts showing voluntary employment, safety training logs)
- Grievance mechanisms for workers to report issues
- If you use agencies or subcontractors, evidence you assess their labor practices

### 2. Environment

**Topics covered**:

- Energy consumption and carbon emissions (Scope 1, 2, and sometimes 3)
- Water usage and wastewater management
- Waste generation and disposal
- Hazardous substances and chemicals management
- Environmental permits and compliance

**What they want**:

- Quantitative data: annual energy (kWh), emissions (tonnes CO₂e), waste (tonnes), water (m³)
- Evidence of environmental management: ISO 14001, environmental permits, improvement initiatives
- Compliance with local regulations and customer-specific requirements (e.g., REACH, RoHS)

### 3. Ethics and Compliance

**Topics covered**:

- Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
- Conflicts of interest
- Fair competition and antitrust compliance
- Data protection and privacy (GDPR)
- Export controls and sanctions compliance

**What they want**:

- Written policies (code of conduct, anti-bribery policy)
- Training records showing employees have been trained on ethics and compliance
- Whistleblowing mechanism (how employees or third parties can report violations)
- No history of corruption, fines, or legal violations (or if there are, corrective actions taken)

### 4. Supply Chain and Procurement

**Topics covered**:

- How you manage your own suppliers
- Supplier assessments (do you evaluate suppliers for ESG risks?)
- Transparency (do you know where your raw materials come from?)
- Conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold)
- Sub-tier supply chain risks

**What they want**:

- Supplier code of conduct
- Evidence you assess suppliers (questionnaires, audits, certifications)
- Due diligence process for high-risk suppliers or regions
- Conflict minerals reporting (if applicable to your industry)

## Pass/Fail vs. Scoring

IntegrityNext doesn't give you a medal or percentile score. Instead, buyers see:

- **Green flags**: Areas where you demonstrate compliance and good practices
- **Yellow flags**: Gaps or areas needing improvement
- **Red flags**: Critical risks (e.g., no forced labor policy, violation of labor laws, environmental fines)

**How buyers use this**:

- **Green across the board**: You're approved, low risk
- **Yellow flags**: Buyer may ask for corrective action plans or additional documentation
- **Red flags**: High risk; may result in disqualification or requirement for immediate remediation

Unlike EcoVadis, where Bronze is still a passing grade, IntegrityNext buyers can set their own thresholds. Some may accept yellow flags with corrective action; others may require all green.

## Evidence Requirements

IntegrityNext heavily emphasizes evidence uploads. For almost every topic, you'll be asked to attach supporting documents.

**Commonly requested evidence**:

- Policies and codes of conduct (PDF uploads)
- Certifications (ISO 9001, 14001, 45001, SA8000, etc.)
- Training records (who was trained, on what topics, when)
- Audit reports (internal audits, customer audits, third-party audits)
- Legal compliance documents (permits, licenses, inspection reports)
- Contracts with suppliers or waste haulers
- Whistleblowing procedures (document describing how to report violations)
- Data logs (energy, water, waste, safety incidents)

**Pro tip**: Prepare a "Document Library" folder before starting the questionnaire. Having everything ready will cut completion time in half.

## How Long Does It Take?

Plan for 6-10 hours for a first-time submission, depending on your company's maturity.

**Time breakdown**:

- **Answering questions**: 2-3 hours
- **Gathering evidence**: 3-5 hours
- **Uploading and organizing documents**: 1-2 hours

If you've completed an EcoVadis or similar assessment recently, you can reuse many documents and answers. Tools like ESG Passport can help you store responses and documents centrally so you're not starting from scratch every time.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

**1. Leaving evidence fields blank**

Even if you answer "Yes," if you don't upload supporting evidence, buyers may treat it as unverified. Always attach a document.

**2. Vague or generic policies**

A one-page policy that says "We comply with all laws" won't cut it. Policies should be specific, signed, dated, and reference the standards you follow (ILO conventions, local labor laws, ISO standards, etc.).

**3. Not addressing high-risk topics**

If you operate in a high-risk country or industry (e.g., manufacturing in regions with known labor risks), buyers will scrutinize your responses more closely. Be proactive: explain what you do to mitigate risks (audits, training, monitoring).

**4. Ignoring your own supply chain**

Many suppliers focus on their direct operations but ignore supplier management. If you source from high-risk regions, have a documented process for assessing and auditing your suppliers.

**5. Waiting until the last minute**

IntegrityNext invitations usually have a deadline (often 30 days). Starting late means rushed answers and missing documents. Begin as soon as you receive the invitation.

## After Submission: What Happens Next?

1. **Buyer review**: Your customer's procurement or compliance team reviews your submission.
2. **Flags and follow-up**: If there are yellow or red flags, they may request clarification, additional evidence, or corrective action plans.
3. **Approval or remediation**: If you pass, you're approved. If risks are identified, you'll need to address them (and possibly resubmit) before approval.
4. **Annual updates**: Many buyers require annual reassessments. Your IntegrityNext profile will need updating each year.

## How to Prepare Before You Receive the Invitation

**1. Review the main categories** (human rights, environment, ethics, supply chain) and ensure you have at least basic policies in place.

**2. Collect core data**:

- Energy consumption, emissions, water, waste
- Workforce metrics (headcount, diversity, turnover)
- Health and safety records (injury rates, training logs)

**3. Organize certifications and permits**:

- ISO certificates
- Environmental and operating permits
- Safety inspection reports

**4. Document your supplier management process**: Even if informal, write down how you select, assess, and monitor suppliers.

**5. Set up a centralized repository**: Store all policies, data, and documents in one place so they're ready when the questionnaire arrives.

## Conclusion

IntegrityNext questionnaires are detailed, evidence-heavy, and closely reviewed. They're designed to help buyers meet legal due diligence obligations, so they take compliance seriously.

The key to success is preparation. Have your policies, data, and documents ready before the invitation arrives. Answer thoroughly, upload evidence for every claim, and address high-risk areas proactively.

Unlike EcoVadis, where you're scored relative to peers, IntegrityNext is about proving you meet specific standards. Focus on demonstrating compliance, transparency, and systematic management, and you'll pass the assessment and stay on your customer's approved supplier list.
