# The Complete Supplier Sustainability Assessment Checklist

Large buyers are sending sustainability questionnaires to their entire supply base. Whether it's EcoVadis, CDP Supply Chain, Sedex, IntegrityNext, or a custom form, they're all asking similar questions. Instead of scrambling every time a new assessment arrives, use this definitive checklist to prepare once and respond quickly to any customer request.

This checklist covers the three ESG pillars: Environment, Social, and Governance. Use it to gather data, prepare documents, and ensure you have evidence ready when buyers come calling.

## Environment: Data and Documentation

## How to Use This Checklist

### Step 1: Conduct a Gap Analysis

Go through this checklist and identify what you have, what you can easily get, and what's missing.

### Step 2: Prioritize Data Collection

Focus first on the items most commonly requested:

- Energy consumption and carbon emissions
- Health and safety metrics (injury rates)
- Workforce numbers and diversity
- Core policies (environment, ethics, labor rights)

### Step 3: Organize and Store Documents Centrally

Create a "Sustainability Documentation" folder (physical or digital) with subfolders:

- Environment
- Social
- Governance
- Certifications
- Policies

Tools like ESG Passport let you store all this in one place and auto-populate questionnaires, saving hours of work every time a new assessment arrives.

### Step 4: Assign Ownership

Designate someone responsible for maintaining this data. It might be an operations manager, HR lead, finance team member, or sustainability coordinator. Ensure they update the information at least annually.

### Step 5: Keep It Current

Review and update annually:

- Energy and water data (after fiscal year close)
- Safety incident records (ongoing, reviewed quarterly)
- Policies (reviewed every 1-2 years)
- Certifications (ensure they're renewed and current)

## What If You Don't Have Everything?

No supplier has 100% of this checklist ready on day one. Prioritize based on:

1. **What customers are asking for right now**: If three customers asked for carbon emissions, prioritize that.
2. **What's easiest to gather**: Start with data you already collect (utility bills, payroll records).
3. **What's material to your industry**: A manufacturer should prioritize energy and safety; a service company might prioritize workforce and data protection.

Be honest in assessments. If you don't track something, say so and explain your plan to start tracking it. Transparency beats vague non-answers.

## Conclusion

The suppliers who excel at sustainability assessments aren't necessarily the most sustainable. They're the most organized. They have data readily available, documents stored centrally, and someone responsible for keeping it current.

Use this checklist to prepare once, then respond quickly and confidently when customers send assessments. The investment in organization pays off in faster responses, higher scores, and fewer last-minute scrambles.
