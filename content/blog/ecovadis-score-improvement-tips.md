# 10 Actionable Tips to Improve Your EcoVadis Score

EcoVadis assessments determine whether suppliers win or lose contracts. A Bronze rating might get you disqualified, while Silver or Gold opens doors. If your score is lower than expected, the good news is that EcoVadis is predictable. Their methodology rewards documentation, policies, and evidence over perfection.

Here are 10 concrete actions that can improve your EcoVadis score on your next reassessment.

## 1. Upload Policies for All Four Themes

EcoVadis assesses four pillars: Environment, Labor & Human Rights, Ethics, and Sustainable Procurement. You need documented policies for each.

**What counts as a policy?**

- A standalone document signed by management
- A section in your employee handbook
- A code of conduct that addresses the topic

If you don't have formal ISO-certified policies, that's fine. Even a two-page document stating your company's position on environmental protection, worker safety, anti-corruption, and supplier expectations will earn points.

**Action**: Write or update a one-page policy for each pillar. Include commitment statements, responsible parties, and review dates.

## 2. Provide Evidence for Every Major Claim

EcoVadis doesn't just read your questionnaire responses. They want supporting documents:

- **Energy tracking**: Upload utility bills, meter readings, or spreadsheets showing annual energy consumption
- **Waste management**: Contracts with waste haulers, recycling reports, or manifests
- **Training**: Training logs, certificates, or attendance sheets
- **Certifications**: ISO 9001, 14001, 45001, or industry standards

**Action**: Create a "Ready to Upload" folder with scanned copies of contracts, certificates, and data logs before starting the assessment.

## 3. Track and Report Quantitative KPIs

EcoVadis heavily weights quantitative indicators. Companies that provide numbers score higher than those that don't.

**Key metrics to track**:

- Total energy consumption (kWh or GJ)
- Water consumption (m³)
- Waste generated and % recycled
- Recordable injury rate (TRIR)
- Employee training hours per year
- Percentage of suppliers assessed for ESG risks

Even if your numbers aren't impressive, reporting them demonstrates transparency and monitoring capability.

**Action**: Start a simple spreadsheet to track monthly energy, water, waste, and safety incidents.

## 4. Establish a Management System (Even a Simple One)

EcoVadis looks for evidence of systematic management, not just ad-hoc actions. You don't need ISO certification, but you need a process.

**Minimum management system elements**:

- Designated responsible person for each theme
- Annual review cycle (document when policies are reviewed)
- Incident tracking and corrective actions
- Management review meetings (even if informal)

**Action**: Assign responsibility in writing. Schedule an annual ESG review meeting and document outcomes.

## 5. Show Continuous Improvement Actions

EcoVadis rewards companies that demonstrate progress, not just compliance.

**Examples of improvement actions**:

- Switching to LED lighting (with before/after kWh data)
- Implementing a recycling program (with diversion rate)
- Conducting supplier audits (document findings and follow-up)
- Providing new training programs (with completion rates)

**Action**: Document at least one improvement project in each of the four themes from the past two years.

## 6. Address Previous Assessment Findings

If you received a prior EcoVadis scorecard, it includes an "Improvement Areas" section. EcoVadis specifically checks whether you've addressed those gaps.

**Action**: Review your last scorecard's improvement recommendations. Prepare documents showing you've taken action on at least some of them.

## 7. Don't Leave Questions Blank

Every unanswered question is a missed opportunity. If a question doesn't apply to your business, explain why instead of skipping it.

For example: "We do not have operations in water-stressed areas. Our single facility is located in [region] with abundant freshwater resources."

This shows you considered the question rather than ignored it.

**Action**: Answer every question. If not applicable, provide a one-sentence explanation.

## 8. Use Precise Language and Avoid Vague Statements

EcoVadis assessors are trained to spot generic, non-specific answers.

**Weak response**: "We care about the environment and comply with all applicable laws."

**Strong response**: "We track monthly electricity consumption (52,000 kWh average) and have reduced usage by 12% since 2024 through LED retrofits. We comply with EU ETS reporting requirements and maintain ISO 14001 certification."

**Action**: Replace vague claims with specific numbers, dates, certifications, and examples.

## 9. Upload Certificates and Third-Party Audits

Third-party verification carries more weight than self-reported data.

**High-value uploads**:

- ISO 9001, 14001, 45001, or 27001 certificates
- Industry-specific certifications (FSC, GOTS, SA8000, etc.)
- Energy audits or carbon footprint reports
- Customer audit reports (if non-confidential)
- Waste transfer notes or recycling certificates

**Action**: If you have any certifications, upload current certificates. If not, consider pursuing ISO 14001 or 45001 if strategically valuable.

## 10. Prepare in Advance Using ESG Passport or Similar Tools

Most suppliers lose points not because of poor performance, but because they scramble at the last minute and submit incomplete responses.

**Best practice**: Maintain a living repository of policies, data, and evidence. Tools like ESG Passport let you store documents and data year-round, so when the EcoVadis questionnaire arrives, you're copying and pasting rather than starting from scratch.

**Action**: Set up a shared folder or system where all ESG-related documents, KPIs, and policies are stored and updated quarterly.

## Realistic Score Expectations

EcoVadis scoring is relative to your industry. Here's what improvement typically requires:

- **Bronze to Silver (45+)**: Add missing policies, upload supporting documents, track KPIs
- **Silver to Gold (62+)**: Demonstrate management systems, improvement trends, and stakeholder engagement
- **Gold to Platinum (76+)**: Show industry leadership, third-party audits, and multi-year performance data

The jump from Bronze to Silver is usually achievable in one reassessment cycle with focused documentation efforts. Gold requires sustained performance and more mature systems.

## Conclusion

Improving your EcoVadis score is less about transforming your operations overnight and more about documenting what you already do, tracking key metrics, and demonstrating systematic management.

Focus on the basics: policies in place, evidence uploaded, KPIs tracked, and continuous improvement documented. These actions consistently move suppliers from Bronze to Silver and from Silver toward Gold.

Start preparing now so your next assessment reflects your actual capabilities, not just your ability to scramble under deadline pressure.
